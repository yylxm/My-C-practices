his is to introduce Mr. Peter Johnson to you. His parents are both my good friends.
He is now going to New York and will spend his vacation there doing some research work on physics at your university.
He hopes to obtain your advice and guidance in laboratory tests.
Many thanks for the trouble you will have to take for Mr. Johnson
